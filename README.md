EM Guide is a tool designed to support the editorial group work of online journalists. 

## Features

## Getting started

### Adding articles

Admin users can add articles in the Conten Manager.

### Email notifications

By default, EM Guide uses [Resed](https://resend.com/) as the default provider for transactional emails. To enable this functionality, you need to specify the RESEND_API_KEY in your .env file. You can change the email provider in the plugin configuration file file located at `/config/plugins.ts`. 
For more details, you can refer to the documentation [here](https://docs.strapi.io/dev-docs/providers).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Development

EM GUIDE is developed using Strapi, a headless content management system (CMS). The Strapi admin panel, built with React, is utilized for content management without the need for a custom frontend. This setup allows for efficient content management tasks.

To enhance functionality, such as admin email notifications and admin comments, custom plugins and lifecycle hooks are integrated. Strapi's robust API capabilities enable the development of a separate admin app if required.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Deployment

### Making changes

1. When making changes that should be reflected upon restarting the Strapi container, follow these steps:

   ` docker compose down`

2. Restart the Docker Compose services with the updated configuration. Use the command:

   ` docker compose up -d`

 This command starts the services in detached mode, allowing you to continue using the terminal.

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues where changes are not visible after restarting the Strapi container, it may be necessary to rebuild the Strapi service without using the cache. Follow these steps:

1. Stop the Docker Compose services if they are running, using:

   `docker compose down`

2. Rebuild the Strapi service without cache to ensure all changes are applied. Use the command:

   `docker compose build strapi --no-cache`

   This command forces Docker to rebuild the Strapi service from scratch, ignoring any cached layers.

3. Restart the Docker Compose services to apply the changes:

   `docker compose up -d`

### Managing Docker System Resources

If you encounter errors related to the build cache size or lack of space on the server, you can manage Docker system resources using the following commands:

1. Check Docker system disk usage with:

   `docker system df`

   This command provides an overview of Docker's disk usage, helping you identify if there's a need to clean up.

2. Remove unused build cache with:

   `docker builder prune`

   This command cleans up the build cache, freeing up space if the build cache is taking up too much space.

3. Remove unused images with:

   `docker image prune`

   This command removes unused images, helping to reclaim disk space.

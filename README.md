## ‚öôÔ∏è General notes

The EM GUIDE tool has been developed using [Strapi](https://strapi.io/), a headless content management system. The Strapi admin panel, built with React, is utilized for content management without the need for a custom frontend. 

The EM GUIDE tool builds upon the Strapi to implement custom functionalities such as email notifications and commenting via custom plugins and lifecycle hooks. 
As feature work, a custom admin interface (frontend) may be implemented using the Strapi API.
